# Keys:
# * = This key is required to be manually set
# + = This is an optional key under a required section
default:                                  # ? | Type | Description
  log:                                    #   | dict | Contains the arguments for logging
    level: warning                        #   | str  | Sets the log level for the console.
    file: !!python/none                   #   | str  | Path to write the log file to. This is always set to the debug level.
    reset: False                          #   | bool | Deletes the old log file if it exists and recreates it for a new run.
    config: !!python/none                 #   | str  | Path to copy the run config to. Useful for creating a copy of the config at runtime in the output directory for future reference.

extract:
  input:                                  # * | dict | Contains all the arguments for the input data of a script
    file: str                             # * | str  | Path to the input h5 file
    key: !!python/none                    # + | str  | Key in the h5 to pull a pandas DataFrame from
  output:                                 #   | dict | Output arguments
    file: !!python/none                   #   | str  | Path to an h5 file to save the extracted windows DataFrame to under the key "windows"
    windows: !!python/none                #   | str  | Path to an h5 file to save individual windows to to help reduce
  window: str                             # * | str  | Size of the windows to extract. The size of these windows is determined by this value divided by the frequency of the data, eg. 10min / 1min = 10 samples. This a is a string compatible with pandas.Timedelta().
  step: 1                                 #   |      | Size of the step when moving from one window to the next. This can be either an int or a str, where an int would step N many indices from the start of the previous window's start, and str would step N amount of time beyond the start of the previous window's start.
  frequency: !!python/none                #   | str  | The sampling frequency of the data. If not set, the frequency will be assumed to be the largest quantity of differences between timestamps. This a is a string compatible with pandas.Timedelta().
  target: str                             # * | str  | Target variable for modeling.
  required: !!python/none                 #   | list | List of required variables when rolling. If not provided, defaults to all variables.
  optional: !!python/none                 #   | list | List of optional variables when rolling. If not provided, defaults to the opposite of `required`.
  columns: []                             #   | list | Only process these columns through tsfresh extraction. Defaults to all columns if not provided.
  index: -1                               #   | int  | Which index of a window to set as the window index. Defaults to the last index of the window.
  classification: False                   #   | bool | Flags that this is a classification run. In this case, set the target value for a window dependent on the target values pre-extraction.
  features:                               #   | dict | Contains the arguments for selecting which tsfresh features to process
    interactive: False                    #   | bool | Enables interactive mode for selection of feature functions from `tsfresh.feature_extraction.ComprehensiveFCParameters`
    whitelist: []                         #   | list | Name of feature functions to accept from `tsfresh.feature_extraction.ComprehensiveFCParameters`
    blacklist: []                         #   | list | Name of feature functions to reject from `tsfresh.feature_extraction.ComprehensiveFCParameters`
