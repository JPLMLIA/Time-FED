    # Optional | bool | Deletes the old log file if it exists and recreates it for a new run.
    reset: False

extract:
  target: label
  # Required | Contains all the arguments for the input data of a script
  input: 
    # Optional | str | Path to the input h5 file
    file: /Users/Urebbapr/research/TimeFED/testing/shampoo/shampoo.data.label.h5
    # Optional | str | Key in the h5 to pull a pandas DataFrame from

    # Optional | str | Path to an h5 file to save individual windows to to help reduce
    windows: null
  # Required | str | Size of the windows to extract. The size of these windows is determined by this value divided by the resolution of the data, eg. 10min / 1min = 10 samples.
  window: 1Y
  # Optional | Size of the step when moving from one window to the next. This can be either an int or a str, where an int would step N many indices from the start of the previous window's start, and str would step N amount of time beyond the start of the previous window's start.
  step: 1
